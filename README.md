# Stock Price Prediction with Deep Learning Model
•	Analyzed the volatility feature of stock price and market index. 

•	Built an RNN long short-term memory model (LSTM) to predict stock prices on PyTorch. 

•	Trained LSTM models and tuned the model by changing sequence lengths, number of layers and dropout values. 

•	Evaluated model based on its performance on test datasets.
